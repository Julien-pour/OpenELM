prompt_solve_puzzle='''You will be given a function and its docstring. Respond only in code with a correct, efficient implementation of the function.
You need to generate the correct solutions (g), for the Problem 3 that satisfies the condition f(g()) == True.
Problem 0:
```

    """Find a selection of at most max_stamps stamps whose total worth is the target value."""

    return len(stamps) <= max_stamps and sum(stamps) == target
```
Solution 0:
```
